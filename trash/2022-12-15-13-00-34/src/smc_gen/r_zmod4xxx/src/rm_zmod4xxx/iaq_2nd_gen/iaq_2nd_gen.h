 * @version 2.2.0
 * @brief   This file contains the data structure definitions and
 *          the function definitions for the 2nd generation IAQ algorithm.
 * @details The library contains an algorithm to calculate an EtOH, TVOC and
 *          IAQ index from ZMOD4410 measurements.
 *          The implementation is made to allow more than one sensor.
