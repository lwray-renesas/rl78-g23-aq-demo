 * @brief   This file contains the data structure definitions and
 *          the function definitions for the 1st generation IAQ algorithm.
 * @details The library contains an algorithm to calculate IAQ, TVOC, eCO2
 *          and EtOH from ZMOD4410 measurements.
 *          The implementation is made to allow more than one sensor.
